# Gamepad Control

_for Blender_

**Gamepad Control** is a Blender add-on that lets you use a game controller or gamepad to navigate and control the 3D viewport in real-time. It provides intuitive camera controls, view manipulation, and customizable gamepad modes that make working in Blender more comfortable and efficient.

Configuration can be done in Preferences -> Input -> Gamepad

Tested currently on Windows-x64 with a PS5 controller

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP of this repository.
2. In Blender, go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**.
3. Click **Install...** and select the ZIP file.
4. Enable **Gamepad Controller** in the list.

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. Connect your gamepad/controller to your computer
2. In the 3D Viewport header, you'll see a gamepad icon when the addon is active
3. Click the icon to access mode controls and settings
4. Enable "Show Overlay" to see current controller mappings in the viewport

### Configuration

1. Go to **Edit > Preferences > Input** and find **Gamepad**
2. Expand the addon preferences to configure:
   - Gamepad modes (create multiple control schemes)
   - Button and axis mappings
   - Sensitivity settings
   - Display preferences
3. Export your settings to share with others or back up your configuration

### View Menu

## Requirements

- Blender 5.0 or newer
- Game controller/gamepad (PlayStation, Xbox, or compatible)

## Known Issues

### Window Control Freeze (Currently Unresolvable)

When using mouse button actions mapped to gamepad triggers (e.g., left trigger for LEFTMOUSE), clicking on Blender's window controls (titlebar, minimize, maximize, close) or dragging the window may cause the interface to freeze.

**What happens:**

- Blender's script execution completely stops when window chrome is interacted with
- If a trigger is released during this freeze, the mouse button release event is never sent
- The window remains "grabbed" by the cursor until you physically click and release the mouse button

**Workaround:**

- Click and release the physical left mouse button to reset the state
- Avoid dragging the window using gamepad mouse button while trigger is pressed

**Why this can't be fixed:**
This is a fundamental limitation of how Blender halts Python script execution during window system interactions. The addon cannot detect or respond to input events while execution is frozen.
