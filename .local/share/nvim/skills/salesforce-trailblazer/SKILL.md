# Salesforce Trailblazer — async agent jobs

Work Trailhead modules with an agent running ahead of you. The workflow is
built on Diver's `dev.sf.trailhead` module
(`/home/phaedrus/.GH/Qompass/Diver/lua/dev/sf/trailhead.lua`): a bounded,
disk-persisted job queue. You enqueue a module, attach steps, start the job,
and the agent works the hands-on parts via the `sf` CLI while you read or
do something else. Sessions survive Neovim restarts.

## Hard boundary: what this skill does NOT do

Trailhead exposes **no public completion API**. There is no endpoint an
agent can call to mark a module unit complete, check a badge, or read
quiz answers. This skill never claims otherwise. The honest split:

- **Agent-verifiable:** org-side state. Did the metadata deploy?
  (`sf project deploy start --source-dir ...`). Do the Apex tests pass?
  (`sf apex run test --tests ... --synchronous`). Does the SOQL return
  the expected rows? (`sf data query`). These are shell steps in the job.
- **Human/browser-side:** clicking through Trailhead units, submitting
  quiz answers, and pressing "check challenge" on hands-on challenges.
  That is done by the user, or by a browser task / MCP tool the user
  explicitly approves — which then reports back through
  `:SfTrailheadDone {id} {step} [result]` / `:SfTrailheadFail {id} {step}
  {error}`. The module is designed for exactly this handoff.

Anything promising automatic badge detection or Trailhead API reads is
fiction. Scope every plan to the split above.

## The workflow

### 1. Enqueue the module

```vim
:SfTrailheadEnqueue {trailmix|quest|study|shell|note} {title}
```

Pick the kind that matches the work: `trailmix` for a whole trailmix,
`quest` for a Trailhead Quest, `study` for reading-heavy modules,
`shell` when the job is mostly CLI work, `note` for research captures.
The command prints the job id — everything else references it.

### 2. Break the module into steps

```vim
:SfTrailheadAddStep {id} {shell|note} {name} [argv...|text...]
```

- `note` steps carry text: the unit's key concepts, quiz-relevant facts,
  links. They complete immediately and become the study log.
- `shell` steps carry an argv list (no shell interpolation — argv form
  only, matching Diver's subprocess discipline) that runs locally via
  `vim.system`, e.g. `sf org create scratch --definition-file
  config/project-scratch-def.json`, `sf project deploy start
  --source-dir force-app`, `sf apex run test --tests MyClassTest
  --synchronous --result-format human`.

A good module plan mirrors the Trailhead unit list: one step per unit,
study units as notes, hands-on units as shell steps against the org.

### 3. Start and monitor

```vim
:SfTrailheadStart {id}     " start (or restart) the job
:SfTrailheadStatus {id}    " one-job status
:SfTrailheadJobs           " list all jobs
:SfTrailheadLog {id}       " bounded log (last 50 lines persisted)
```

Steps run in order; a shell step's exit code decides pass/fail. The queue
is bounded (4 active jobs, 256 steps/job, 15-minute step timeout) so a
stuck org command can't hang the session forever. Job state is written
to disk, so `:SfTrailheadResume {id}` picks up after a restart.

### 4. Verify hands-on challenges

For each hands-on step, verify **in the org**, not in the browser:

1. Deploy the unit's metadata: `sf project deploy start --source-dir
   <path> --target-org <alias>`.
2. Run the relevant tests: `sf apex run test --tests <ClassName>
   --synchronous --result-format human` — zero failures required.
3. For data/setup challenges: `sf data query --query "SELECT ..."` and
   confirm the rows exist.
4. Mark the step done with the evidence as the result string, or failed
   with the error output. The log keeps the receipts.

### 5. Pause / resume / cancel

```vim
:SfTrailheadResume {id}     " resume a paused/interrupted job
:SfTrailheadCancel {id}     " cancel one job
:SfTrailheadCancelAll       " cancel everything active
```

Async means the user walks away: always leave the job resumable, never
assume the session stays open.

## Certification vouchers

`:SfTrailheadQuests` prints the researched voucher sources from the
module, each labeled VERIFIED (confirmed against an official Salesforce
source) or SPECULATIVE (third-party/unconfirmed). Verified entries in
the module: Trailhead Quests (monthly themed challenges, voucher is a
prize not guaranteed), Trailhead Coach (Workforce Partner / Talent
Alliance cohorts only), Trailhead Military (active duty, reserve, guard,
veterans, military spouses), AI Associate / AI Specialist free first
attempts (time-bound promotion — re-verify before planning around it).
Speculative: Certification Days (50%-off historically, program status
unconfirmed), community meetup raffles, third-party voucher trackers.
Quote the label when passing these to the user.

## Activation

<skill_resources>
manifest:
  files: []
  note: SKILL.md only. The job queue lives in Diver's
    lua/dev/sf/trailhead.lua and is driven through the :SfTrailhead*
    user commands; the Salesforce CLI does the org-side work. Nothing is
    bundled in the skill.
</skill_resources>

- **Per-session dedup:** never re-inject this skill into a session whose
  context already contains it. If the skill text is present, act on it —
  do not paste it again or summarize it back.
- **Subagent delegation verdict: recommended.** Trailhead jobs are the
  textbook async workload: long, non-interactive hands-on runs (deploys,
  test suites) with persisted state and a bounded log. Delegate the job
  to a subagent, hand it the job id and the step plan, and have it
  report via :SfTrailheadStatus / :SfTrailheadLog checkpoints. Keep
  browser-side completion with the user or an explicitly approved
  browser task — never let a subagent freelance browser actions.

## Rejected scope

- Automatic badge/unit completion detection — impossible, no Trailhead
  API (see hard boundary).
- Quiz-answer lookup or answer automation — not a real workflow in the
  config; excluded deliberately.
- Trailhead GO / mobile offline modules — no CLI backing, out of scope.
